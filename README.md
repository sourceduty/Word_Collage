[Word Collage](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-l60y3eqGq-word-collage) is designed to help users create unique, text-based collages in a plain text format. Users provide a list of words, and Word Collage generates a layout where the words are arranged in a random, visually interesting format, with different font sizes to add variety and appeal. The collages are created with a black-on-white color scheme, ensuring a clean, minimalistic look. Depending on the userâ€™s choice, the collage can be in small, medium, or large size, accommodating 50, 200, and 500 words respectively. The collage is designed so that the words do not overlap or intersect, giving each word its own space within the layout, similar to an artful arrangement on a blank canvas.

This tool supports creativity by guiding users through the process of choosing words and collage size. It also ensures that all words fit comfortably within the collage borders, making it easy for users to visualize their ideas in text form. By focusing on the use of font size and layout, Word Collage creates a striking visual effect without using colors or images. Once complete, the collage is shared with the user as a plain text file, ready for use in digital projects, creative writing, or other forms of expression. The experience is designed to be user-friendly and engaging, encouraging a smooth and imaginative process.
